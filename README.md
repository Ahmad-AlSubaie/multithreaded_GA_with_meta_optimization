# multithreaded_GA_with_meta_optimization
This multithreaded genetic algorith writen in list optimizes a floating point vector, the parameters for this optimization (mutaion chance, mutaion variance ect..) is optimized by a second level genetic algorithom.
This project was created for an artificial intelegence class in spring 2020. This was writen in lisp sbcl.
